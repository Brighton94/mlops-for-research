## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   # Replace with your repository URL
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mlops-for-research.git
   cd mlops-for-research
   ```

### 🚀 Usage

1. **Data Version Control (DVC)**:
   - Initialize DVC in your project:
     ```bash
     dvc init
     ```
   - Add data files to DVC:
     ```bash
     dvc add data/raw/dataset.csv
     ```
   - Track data changes:
     ```bash
     dvc push
     dvc pull
     ```
   - Create data pipelines:
     ```bash
     dvc run -n prepare -d src/prepare.py -o data/prepared/dataset.csv python src/prepare.py
     ```

2. **MLflow Tracking**:
   - Start the MLflow tracking server using the provided script:
     ```bash
     ./start_mlflow.sh
     ```
   - Or start manually:
     ```bash
     mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
     ```
   - Track experiments in your code:
     ```python
     import mlflow
     
     with mlflow.start_run():
         mlflow.log_param("param1", value1)
         mlflow.log_metric("metric1", value1)
         mlflow.log_artifact("path/to/artifact")
     ```
   - View experiment results:
     ```bash
     mlflow ui
     ```

3. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```
